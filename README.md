# Slides for UKHSA Code Review Workshop

The Markdown presentation tool [marp](https://marp.app/) is used to build the
slides in the top level Markdown file. Please see the [workflow
file](.github/workflows/marp-to-pages.yml) to see how to build these locally. A
Docker image of marp is used in the workflow, and that seems to be the easiest
way to do things locally (rather than making sure you have node.js and npm
available).
